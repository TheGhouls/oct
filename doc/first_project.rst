Your first project
==================

Once OCT is installed on your system you will have access to several command-line tools
to help you using it, write your test or run your project.

For thirs first part we gonna use the ``oct-newproject`` command for creating our first project.

.. code-block:: sh

    oct-newproject my_project_name

This command will create a folder named ``my_project_name`` containing all the required
files for you to start an OCT project.

Let's take a look at the content of this new folder :

.. code-block:: sh

    ── config.json
    ├── templates
    │   ├── css
    │   │   └── style.css
    │   ├── footer.html
    │   ├── head.html
    │   ├── img
    │   ├── report.html
    │   └── scripts
    └── test_scripts
        └── v_user.py
